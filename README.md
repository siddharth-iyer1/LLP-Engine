# LLP-Engine

## Description
A Java Library that standardizes parallelization of algorithms, including Prefix Sum, Bellman-Ford, Prim's, and Optimal BST, through an innovative engine utilizing Lattice Linear Predicate (LLP). This engine facilitates seamless integration, allowing users to input a predicate and adapt it across various algorithm types.

## How to Run

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/siddharth-iyer1/LLP-Engine.git
$ cd LLP-Engine
$ mvn package
```

This will run random test cases generated by TestCaseGenerator.java.

## Testing

Lists and Graphs are randomly generated in the TestCaseGenerator.java file and example Test Cases generated by this class can be seen in the "test/java/com/The/Boiz/tests" directory.
For direct testing and running of algorithms on individual test cases, I would recommend pasting test cases into the Runner.java file's main method. Example tests are there for context.
